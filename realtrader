I see a lot of people ask the question, "I'm new to this forum and want to learn how to become a day trader." so I decided to create this post. You can learn everything about day trading from YouTube videos - this is TRUE. However, I personally recommend taking a course - it will be ENTIRELY up to you if you decide to invest in a day trading course.

This is for people who want to trade STOCKS and DOES NOT cover trading OPTIONS.

Also, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE! I am not a financial advisor and I do not teach how to day trade. I am simply providing how to START your journey to becoming a trader. My list provides YouTube video links but YOU should seek out your own videos as well.

TRADING PATTERNS

This is my opinion but I believe there are two types of styles to trading stocks, YOU will need to decide if you wish to trade using INDICATORS or trade using only CANDLESTICK PATTERNS (I don't use indicators but that is MY STYLE, you may be different). Once you pick a path that suits your personality, stick with just 2 patterns before trying to learn more. There is a LOT of information out there, I'm only scratching the surface to get you started. The REST IS UP TO YOU!

Everything I posted above only scratches the surface of the learning required to become a successful day trader. There are MILLIONS of videos out there and there are REAL RISKS to trading if you do not learn the basics. Even professionals have days where they lose money.

BROKERAGES FOR DAY TRADING

Just know that intra-day trading requires a brokerage account with at least $25,000.00 in it for unlimited trades. For starting out, $0 brokerages are good for beginners.

(OPTIONAL) DAY TRADING COURSES

Day trading courses ARE NOT CHEAP! At least, the really good ones are not cheap. Why? Because they only want SERIOUS BUYERS and they have spent years mastering their techniques. If you go this route, expect to spend around $2,000.00 to $5,000.00 depending on how in-depth you wish to go. These are only a select few recommendations based on reviews and my own personal research. My suggestion is that you pick someone who RESONATES WITH YOU. In other words, their personality must fit yours.

This list is in no particular order:

BabyPips - (Yes, this is FOREX but a great way to get started in trading)

Bear Bull Traders

Bulls on Wall Street

Live Traders (I took this course)

Clay Trader

https://www.marketlifetrading.com/users/sign_in This is a free course if you don't want to spend money.

I hope this helps you in your journey to GET STARTED in learning how to become a day trader. I've only laid out the basic guidelines in this post and I cannot stress how much MORE you should be doing on your own to figure out what best works for YOU!

Thanks for reading, share if you wish, and good luck in your endeavors!
